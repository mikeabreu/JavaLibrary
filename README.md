#Library of Code

This is a collection of code that I have written in the past. The purpose of this library is for reference. Anyone is welcome to use any or all of the code that is found here. This code is licensed under MIT license.

##Programming Languages

There are multiple programming languages used in this code base. I have separated each language to its unique branch. If you are looking for Ruby code please checkout the Ruby branch, and so on.

Here is a list of the different languages you will find here:

1. Ruby
2. JavaScript
3. Java
4. Python
5. PHP
6. Bash

I have tried to mimic code from one language to another but you may not find everything has been transferred over.

##Contributing

I encourage anyone to find flaws in my code and help me correct them. I would like to eventually have a working library of efficient, secure, and best practiced code. Feel free to fork this repo and work on the code locally.

##Issues

As much as I would like to think I'm an good programmer, things go awry. If you find that something in this library of code doesn't work please make a new issue and I'll try to answer it as soon as I can.

If you found an issue and fixed it yourself, great! I would love for you to make a pull request back into this repo so I can use your awesome new code.
