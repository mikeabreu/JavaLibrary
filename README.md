# Code Library

This GitHub repository was created to store code that I've wrote. Anyone is welcome to use my code for their purpose abiding to the GNU License.

## How to Use this Repo

In order to organize the repo I have divided the different programming languages to their respective branch.

`git clone https://github.com/mikeabreu/lib /opt/

cd /opt/lib`

To checkout any of the branches
`git checkout BranchName`
`git checkout Java`
`git checkout Python`

## Programming Languages

There are multiple programming languages used in this code base. I have separated each language to its unique branch. If you are looking for Ruby code please checkout the Ruby branch, and so on.

List of Programming Languages:

- Java
- Python
- PHP
- Bash
- PowerShell

I have tried to mimic code from one language to another but you may not find everything has been transferred over.

## Contributing

I encourage anyone to find flaws in my code and help me correct them. I would like to eventually have a working library of efficient, secure, and best practiced code. Feel free to fork this repo and work on the code locally.

## Issues

As much as I would like to think I'm an good programmer, things go awry. If you find that something in this library of code doesn't work please make a new issue and I'll try to answer it as soon as I can.

If you found an issue and fixed it yourself, great! I would love for you to make a pull request back into this repo so I can use your awesome new code.
